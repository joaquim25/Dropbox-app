# Dropbox-app 
A cloud storage application implemented in two different programming paradigms: functional programming (FP) and object-oriented programming (OOP). 
This project demonstrates the same core functionality and features in the two distinct programming styles.

## Key Features
- Account Management: Create basic and premium accounts with specified storage capacities.
- File Upload: Upload files into user accounts, ensuring they do not exceed the available storage space.
- File Sharing: Share files between users, taking into account storage constraints and account types.
- List Files: View a list of files within a specific account.
- List All Accounts: Display a list of all registered accounts.
- Update Files: Update file information and track the last user to modify a file.
- Retrieve Last Update: Check who last updated a specific file.

#### - The FP version of this project emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data structures. It demonstrates how to manage application state and perform operations using a functional approach.
#### - The OOP version, on the other hand, showcases the benefits of encapsulation, inheritance, and object-oriented design principles. It demonstrates how to model the application's entities as classes and interact with them using object-oriented techniques.
